Run the app using the start-app.bat file for the dev mode, allowing you to see the current users, it may be bugged initially but it will fix itself within five minutes and then remain fixed.

in the dev users tab you may login to a given account which will show its username in the top right

do note it may take a second for the backend to start

ive added a production bat to start the production version aswell
